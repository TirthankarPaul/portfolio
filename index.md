## Data Analysis Works:
* **Lending analysis for banking and financial data:** The Case study is based on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). It is mainly banking and financial understanding to minimise the risk factor of charged off loan in the lending customar. The analysis is to find the parameters which are the driving factor of detecting the defaulters from the past datasets.

* **The USA based BoomBikes sharing case study to accelerate the revenue earning:** The analysis will help to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## Research Achievements:  

* _**Detection of intra-family coronavirus genome sequences through graphical representation and artificial neural network:**_ In this study, chaos game representation (CGR) is introduced for investigating the pattern of genome sequences. It is an image representation of the genome for the overall visualization of the sequence. The CGR representation is a mapping technique that assigns each sequence base into the respective position in the two-dimension plane to portray the DNA sequence. Importantly, CGR provides one to one mapping to nucleotides as well as sequence. A coordinate of the CGR plane can tell the corresponding base and its location in the original genome. Therefore, the whole nucleotide sequence (until the current nucleotide) can be restored from the one point of the CGR. In this study, CGR coupled with artificial neural network (ANN) is introduced as a new way to represent the genome and to classify intra-coronavirus sequences. A hierarchy clustering study is done to validate the approach and found to be more than 90% accurate while comparing the result with the phylogenetic tree of the corresponding genomes. Interestingly, the method makes the genome sequence significantly shorter (more than 99% compressed) saving the data space while preserving the genome features.
